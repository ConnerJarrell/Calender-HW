For this HW we will be creating a scheduler to help organize your day.

I chose to use a 9am-5pm work day scheduler, for the common work hours. However could even go up to 24 hours for a full day.

I have color coded the time blocks to Red when it is past the time. Green when it is upcoming. Blue when it is currently that hour.
